# Next Online Store

Hey guys, Welcome to Next-Store, this is a full working online store built with php, ajax, jquery and javascript. I built this project for one of my web development classes that i was taking up at Stamford International University.

## Getting Started

If youd like to build upon this project and make something cool of it feel free to do so (only for educational purposes), youll need to install a server on your localhost and copy the files there. Also you may need to import the SQL file into phpmyadmin so that the website operates.The following are the two things ull need:

```
Wamp Server OR any other localhost server
Php myadmin inorder to settup the required database ( website will not work without the database)
```
 

### Prerequisites

If youre thinking on working further in this project ull have to have some knowllege on Bootstrap, Javascript and PHP mainly. Although if you are a beginner feel free to try it out the website is prety simple and straightforward to understand!
